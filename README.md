Project Name: SOC (Save Our Car)

SOC is an android application, when using SOC you can locate closest mechanic to you and send them an SMS message or call them through the app if your car has broken down. It will also include all the insurance companies numbers and information.

Plan out the deign of the project
Plan how the basic functionality will work and where I will keep my data.
When talking with my project supervisor we agreed that I should not use a server for my database such as SQL as it would take a long time to retrieve any data if the user had a poor data connection. Instead I will research if I can keep the data inside the application itself.
